      - use benchmarks to determine best chunk size
      - benchmark chunk size speedup for more complicated computations of list
        elements.
      - extend throughput benchmarks with declarative versions of loops

  * fast serialization for 'Text' values (currently unpacking to 'String' is
    the fastest :-/)

  * extend tests to new functions
