  
  * custom serialization functions for lists of 'WordX's
      - use benchmarks to determine best chunk size
      - benchmark chunk size speedup for more complicated computations of list
        elements.

  * fast serialization for 'Text' values (currently unpacking to 'String' is
    the fastest :-/)

  * implement further encodings for 'Char'

  * extend tests to new functions

  * benchmarks
      - understand why the declarative blaze-builder version is the fastest
        serializer for Word64 little-endian and big-endian 

  * documentation
      - test if {-# UNPACK #-} no longer disturbs haddock

  * benchmark if it is beneficial to concatenate small bytestrings before compression

  * check portability to Hugs

  * naming issue: modules for all the different encodings or names as in
