* blaze-builder-0.2.0.0

  Heavily restructured 'blaze-builder' such that 'Text.Blaze.Builder' serves as
  a drop-in replacement of 'binary:Data.Binary.Builder' which it improves upon
  with respect to both speed as well as expressivity. See the documentation and
  the benchmarks for details on improvements and new functionality.

  Changed module structure:
    Text.Blaze.Builder.Core -> Text.Blaze.Builder
    Text.Blaze.Builder.Utf8 -> Text.Blaze.Builder.Char.Utf8
    Text.Blaze.Builder.Html -> Text.Blaze.Builder.Html.Utf8 

  Changed function names:
    writeByte     -> writeWord8
    fromByte      -> fromWord8
    fromWriteList -> fromWrite1List

  Possibly performance sensitive implementation changes:
    - 'fromByteString' and 'fromLazyByteString' check now if a direct insertion
      of the bytestring(s) would be cheaper than copying it. See their
      documentation on how to recover the old behaviour.

  Deprecated functions:
    'empty'    : use 'mempty' instead
    'singleton': use 'fromWord8' instead
    'append'   : use 'mappend' instead
  

* blaze-builder-0.1

  This is the first version of 'blaze-builder'. It is explicitely targeted at
  fast generation of UTF-8 encoded HTML documents in the 'blaze-html' and the
  'hamlet' HTML templating libraries.
