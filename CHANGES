* 0.2.1.0

  Incorporated several design changes:
    - Writable buffer range is now represented in a packed form. This improves
      speed slightly, as less currying is used.
    - Writes are abstracted such that their internal representation can be
      exchanged without breaking other library code.
    - Writes are represented in a form that allows for efficient monoid
      instances for branching code like UTF-8 encoding. For single character
      encoding this results currently in a slight slowdown due to GHC not
      recognizing the strictness of the returned value. This will be fixed in
      the future.
    - BuildSteps support returning a result in `Done`, which enables to 
      implement a `Put` monad using CPS.
    - chunked list writes were removed, as they result in worse performance
      when writing non-trivial lists. (cf. benchmarks)
    - An internal buffering abstraction is introduced, which is used both
      by the adaption of the `binary` package, as well as by the
      `blaze-builder-enumeratee` package, to execute puts and builders.
      It will be used later also by the execution functions of the
      `blaze-builder` package.
  
  Implemented new functionality
    - `Blaze.ByteString.Builder.HTTP` provides a builder transformer for 
       doing in-buffer chunked HTTP encoding of an arbitary other builder.
    - `Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Char.Latin1` provides writes and builders for
      serializing characters using the `Latin1` (ISO_8859-1) charset. This
      corresponds to what the bytestring library refers to as the Char8
      encoding.

* 0.2.0.2

  Fixed bug: use &#39; instead of &apos; for HTML escaping '

* 0.2.0.1
  
  Added a missing benchmark file.

* blaze-builder-0.2.0.0

  Heavily restructured 'blaze-builder' such that 'Blaze.ByteString.Builder' serves as
  a drop-in replacement of 'binary:Data.Binary.Builder' which it improves upon
  with respect to both speed as well as expressivity. See the documentation and
  the benchmarks for details on improvements and new functionality.

  Changed module structure:
    Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Core -> Blaze.ByteString.Builder
    Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Utf8 -> Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Char.Utf8
    Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Html -> Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Html.Utf8 

  Changed function names:
    writeByte     -> writeWord8
    fromByte      -> fromWord8
    fromWriteList -> fromWrite1List

  Possibly performance sensitive implementation changes:
    - 'fromByteString' and 'fromLazyByteString' check now if a direct insertion
      of the bytestring(s) would be cheaper than copying it. See their
      documentation on how to recover the old behaviour.

  Deprecated functions:
    'empty'    : use 'mempty' instead
    'singleton': use 'fromWord8' instead
    'append'   : use 'mappend' instead
  

* blaze-builder-0.1

  This is the first version of 'blaze-builder'. It is explicitely targeted at
  fast generation of UTF-8 encoded HTML documents in the 'blaze-html' and the
  'hamlet' HTML templating libraries.
